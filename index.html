    <p>this is the inside of the EVENT SCORE. the <i>CONTENT</i>. the EVENT SCORE is a FLUXUS practice that dictates instructions (a score) for a piece of performance ART. sometimes the performance is performable but sometimes it is more about the feeling of the performance or even the poetry of the instructions that make the ART piece. EVENT SCORES are relatable to dadaist and surrealist practices. </p>

    <p>The individual abandons the flawless quartz in the keyhole of the 100 year-old brick house. In harmony with the mourning

        height of the tallest ginkgo tree and the wind mimics the individualâ€™s whistled tune, the escape has been made.</p>
