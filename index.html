    <h1>EVENT SCORE</h1>
    <p>this is the inside of the EVENT SCORE. the <i>CONTENT</i>. <strike>how does that make me feel? pretty bad.</strike>  the EVENT SCORE is a FLUXUS practice that dictates instructions (a score) for a piece of performance ART. sometimes the performance is performable but sometimes it is more about the feeling of the performance or even the poetry of the instructions that make the ART piece. EVENT SCORES are relatable to dadaist and surrealist practices. </p>
    <p>look beneath this paragraph to see an example of a simple <b>EVENT SCORE</b></p>
    <h2>EXIT #18 (or - on the action of home-leaving)</h2>
    <p>the individual abandons the flawless quartz in the keyhole and, in harmony with the mourning dove, takes flight from 
        the place of their conception.</p>

    <h4>EXIT #18 (or - on the action of home-leaving)</h4>
    <p>The individual abandons the flawless quartz in the keyhole of the 100 year-old brick house. In harmony with the mourning
        dove the individual takes flight from the place of their conception. When the field of awareness has expanded beyond the 
        height of the tallest ginkgo tree and the wind mimics the individualâ€™s whistled tune, the escape has been made.</p>
